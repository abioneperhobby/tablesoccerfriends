Develop a web app while having fun,  mixing two hobbies : computer programming and table soccer. That’s how I decided to create:

Table Soccer Friends is developed using modern html5 technologies which make it compatible with every mobile browser, you just have to visit:

There is a lot of work to do and I know it. Remember that Table Soccer Friends is an amateur project so every time I feel like I want to try a new technology or i want to develop a new functionality … i will do it!  Keep in mind that Table Soccer Friends is your free companion app ! <3

# under the hood

Table Soccer Friends is an amateur project developed to learn code while having fun: i wanted to develop a product for table soccer (calcetto balilla) player, caring about all the aspects, from database to web services,  from website to mobile application.

Code after code, Table Soccer Friends is finally born and now it takes every moment of my (few) free time to get updates. What’s under the hood? and why?

# Hosting

While planning the product I considered the availability and the costs of several hosting services, and at the end I have chosen the hated but commonly used apache+mysql+php stack. There is nothing new about those platforms but i needed a well known stack in order to overcome initial troubles. I chose an Italian hosting service: “Cheweb”, which I’ve already tried in the past, and i felt like it gave me good uptime and a high Google page speed score.
